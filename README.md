# PathFinder
This project is pathfinding visualizer written in c++. General overview of the code is that there is class Board which job is to handle all the visuals and then because I already had existing code for the actual pathfinding algorithms I made PathFinder class to handel all conversions and other stuff so I wouldn't need to change the code for the algorithms too much since they are far the "biggest" in this project.
